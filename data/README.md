## Data sources

Data used in this project comes from the WiDS Datathon 2026 (WatchDuty wildfire data).

Due to licensing and size constraints, raw data files are not included in this repository.
They are downloaded programmatically in the notebook using Kaggle API.

See `notebook.ipynb` for full data access instructions.
